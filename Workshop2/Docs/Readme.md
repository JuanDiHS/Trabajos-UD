WORKSHOP 2
This workshop is focused on build a backend system with a catalog of vehicles to be sell in a car company.

For this case, some requirements are defined as follows:

Each vehicle has at least engine, chasis (A or B), model, gas consumption, and year. Depending on the vehicle type, you should define additional properties.
There are different vehicle types (for now): car, truck, yacht, and motorcycle.
Each engine has at least a name, type of engine, potency, and weight.
To calculate the vehicle gas consumption you could create a method based on: 1.1 ∗ engine.potency + 0.2 ∗ engine.weight - (0.3 if A or 0.5 if B)
The idea in this workshop is to provide some UML Diagramas in order to understand in a better way the system and also detect any potential improvement.

In this folder a folder called images is used to save the diagrams, and a file called Technical Report.pdf saves the information related to the workshop development. In addition, a folder called src has the code related to the project in the last version.
